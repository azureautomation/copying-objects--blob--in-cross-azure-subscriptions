Copying Objects (Blob) in cross Azure Subscriptions
===================================================

            


In Azure copying objects from one subscription to another subscription OR within same subscription is very easy without any complexity. In this copy you don’t need to provide subscription ID or address
 etc.








To access storage accounts in Azure a key is required. Key you can get from Azure portal (As shown below in properties of Azure Storage Account).

TechNet gallery is retiring! This script was migrated from TechNet script center to GitHub by Microsoft Azure Automation product group. All the Script Center fields like Rating, RatingCount and DownloadCount have been carried over to Github as-is for the migrated scripts only. Note : The Script Center fields will not be applicable for the new repositories created in Github & hence those fields will not show up for new Github repositories.
